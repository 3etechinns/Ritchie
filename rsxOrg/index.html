            <h1>Ritchie Stock Exchange&trade;</h1>
            <p>Welcome!</p>
            <p>"Ritchie" is an Alternative Trading System (ATS) that is created, built, run, and managed by the open-source community.<sup><small>1</small></sup></p>
            
            <p>In the spirit of "The Open Source Way,"<sup><small>2</small></sup> we believe that a market--and its data--must be free, open, and transparent to be "fair and orderly:"</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Designed for Algorithmic Trading.</b></li>
                <li><b>No "non-display" fees.</b> Ritchie is designed from the ground up for non-display.</li>
                <li><b>Affordable colocation fees</b>. Colocation is affordable at Ritchie. Your algos can be run on a device as small as a Raspberry Pi<sup><small>TM</small></sup>.</li>
                <li><b>Random matching algorithm</b>. Not a FIFO order queue, an <b>array</b> where orders are matched randomly.</li>
                <li><b>Real-time tick data are free.</b> Easily accessed through our API.</li>
                <li><b>Open Order Book/DOM.</b></li>
                <li><b>Open API.</b> Designed for algorithmic trading and quantitative analysis.</li>
                <li><b>Open Architecture.</b> The inner workings of the exchange are open for public scrutiny.</li>
                <li><b>Open Order Arrays.</b>
                <li><b>Free FIX adapter</b></li>
                <li><b>Open Source!</b></li>
            </ul>
            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/colocateRitchie2.jpg" alt="Colocation fees are affordable and equal for all.">
            <br>
            <p>Being first into the array does not guarantee getting matched first. A random number is generated to determine which order gets matched next:</p>
            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/matching.png" alt="Random matching algorithm pairs buy order #2 in line and ask order #5.">
            <br>
            <p>All that being said, there are limits:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Anonymity is strictly enforced.</b> The identity of market participants is not public information.</li>
            <li><b>Commissions are charged.</b> An industry-standard fee schedule is equitably applied to all transactions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In sum, the guiding principle at Ritchie is that of a meritocracy:</p>
            <p class="quote">In a meritocracy, the best ideas win. In a meritocracy, everyone has access to the same information. Successful work determines which projects rise and gather effort from the community.<sup><small>2</small></sup></p>
            
            <h2>Why contribute to Ritchie?</h2>
            <p>You will find here the best, brightest, and most innovative people in the world: The Open Source Community. These are the people who built Linux, FireFox, MySQL, Wordpress, Nodejs, myBB (which drives our forum), and countless other successful projects. </p>

            <p>Ritchie provides you with a great opportunity to participate in all aspects of making a market:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Manage an order book</li>
                <li>Match orders</li>
                <li>FIX protocol</li>
                <li>Multithreading</li>
                <li>Low latency</li>
                <li>Cryptography and security</li>
                <li>API creation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some of the most challenging problems and powerful systems exist in the Financial industry. You will grow from working on this project.</p>
            <p>Experience in finance can be hard to obtain. Often people seeking work in this industry find themselves between a rock and a hard place: they need experience in the industry to find a job, but can't find a job in the industry because they don't have experience. Ritchie can help to bridge that gap, and give you an opportunity to work on a financial system.</p>

            <h2>Why List on Ritchie?</h2>
            <p>If you have a winning idea, then this is the place for you. In no other venue can you so easily connect with investors. Ritchie is a profitable market where innovation and creativity thrive.<p>

            <h2>How is Ritchie organized?</h2>

                <li>The adapter communicates using FIX</li>
                <li>For colocated equipment, we now recommend C++ on Linux.
            </ul>
            <h2>What is the origin of the "Ritchie" name?</h2>
            <p>This exchange is named after Dennis Ritchie:</p>
            <p class="quote">Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 â€“ c. October 12, 2011) was an American computer scientist. He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system. Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999. Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007. He was the "R" in K&R C, and commonly known by his username dmr."<sup><small>3</small></sup></p> 
            <h2>How do I get involved?</h2>
            <p>The first step is to post on the forums, in the "I'm in!" section, at alphastockexchange.net. There we will discuss with you what you'd like to work on. You will then be assigned to a team, and can start contributing.</p>

            <h2>Documentation</h2>
            <p>We at Ritchie believe in great documentation. Writing docs is not the sexiest work, but it's extremely important. It must be done, and done well. Well-written docs make things easy for the consumers, and separate a good system from a great one.</p>
            <p>If you build something, please document it here.</p>
            <p>These docs are part of our github repo. Check it out, look for the <code>docs/</code> directory, document your stuff, commit, and issue a pull request--just like anything else.</p>
            <p>This site uses Bootstrap. If you haven't seen it, it's well worth the investment of time to learn. At this time, it holds the position as the #1 repo on Github, with more than 100,000 stars. Check out the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap Site</a>, and there's lots of tutorials on YouTube.</p>
            <p>For the API, we use the Handlebars templating engine. This is a little more involved, but not too bad. For the most part, this is for programmers so it's generally not a problem. Check out the <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> Web site for help.<p>
            <p>Often you can copy n' paste the docs for something simlar to what you're doing, make changes as you see fit, and create a new menu item if necessary.</p>
            <p>If you are having trouble, post in the forums under "Documentation" and we will help you.</p>
            <p>You may be wondering, "Why aren't they using a documentation generation engine?" Although for some projects they are the perfect solution, we chose not to use one to create Ritchie docs:<p>
            <ol>
              <li>We feel that the inline comments required by these systems clutter the code base.</li>
              <li>They can increase the <i>quantity</i> of docs, but don't necessarily help to improve their <i>quality</i>.</li>
              <li>Inline documentation can dilute the value of source-code comments. By requiring that docs are separately written, the comments that coders add are highly focused, concise, and meaningful.</li>
              <li>The best docs are those carefully and concisely handwritten by the contributor.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We have made every effort to simplify creation of docs. We use some of the best open-source packages available, have a forum to help you if you get stuck. Writing Ritchie docs will also buff your skill set and resume with Bootstrap, jQuery, and Handlebars, and maybe help you to land that dream job.</p>
            <p>So, please, take a moment to document your contributions, and be sure to include some relevant examples. It's really important.</p>
            <p>Thank you, Keith :^)</p>
