# Usage
## Engine/Acceptor
The Ritchie engine is designed to run on Linux, but it should run on Windows with a few tweaks if you're a Visual Studio person.

At the command prompt:
pickledEgg> make

To start the process and make your market
pickledEgg> ./ritchie

## Client/Initiator

Separate clients are available: one for Linux/Mac, a second for Windows. This enables the Windows peeps to work with the code in Visual Studio, generate solution files and all sorts of Microsoft-specific stuff, use winsock2.h, etc., without cluttering the Linux files.

I know, in a perfect world, this code would be perfectly portable, and we would have exactly one code base for all platforms. Please don't judge me.

# Ritchie

Welcome to the Ritchie Stock Exchangeâ„¢!

"Ritchie" is an Alternative Trading System (ATS) that is created, built, run, and managed by the open-source community.

In the spirit of "The Open Source Way,"[2] we believe that a market--and its data--must be free, open, and transparent to be "fair and orderly:"

- Designed for Algorithmic Trading.
- No "non-display" fees. Ritchie is designed from the ground up for non-display.
- Affordable colocation fees. Colocation is affordable at Ritchie. Your algos can be run on a device as small as a Raspberry Pi(TM).
- Random matching algorithm. Not a FIFO order queue, an array where orders are matched randomly.
- Real-time tick data are free. Easily accessed through our API.
- Open Order Book/DOM.
- Open API. Designed for algorithmic trading and quantitative analysis.
- Open Architecture. The inner workings of the exchange are open for public scrutiny.
- Open Order Arrays.
- Free FIX adapter
- Open Source!
