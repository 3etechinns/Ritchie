# Ritchie

Welcome to the Ritchie Stock Exchangeâ„¢!

"Ritchie" is an Alternative Trading System (ATS) that is created, built, run, and managed by the open-source community.

In the spirit of "The Open Source Way,"[2] we believe that a market--and its data--must be free, open, and transparent to be "fair and orderly:"

- Designed for Algorithmic Trading.
- No "non-display" fees. Ritchie is designed from the ground up for non-display.
- Affordable colocation fees. Colocation is affordable at Ritchie. Your algos can be run on a device as small as a Raspberry Pi(TM).
- Random matching algorithm. Not a FIFO order queue, an array where orders are matched randomly.
- Real-time tick data are free. Easily accessed through our API.
- Open Order Book/DOM.
- Open API. Designed for algorithmic trading and quantitative analysis.
- Open Architecture. The inner workings of the exchange are open for public scrutiny.
- Open Order Arrays.
- Free FIX adapter
- Open Source!
